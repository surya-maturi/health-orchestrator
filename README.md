# 🩺 Container and Microservices Health Orchestrator

## 📌 Problem Statement

In distributed microservices environments, failures are inevitable — but downtime doesn’t have to be. This project delivers an **intelligent health orchestrator** that continuously monitors the health of microservices and automatically performs **healing actions** such as:

- Service restarts
- Dynamic scaling
- Intelligent traffic rerouting

The goal is to **maximize uptime and resiliency** through AI-powered decision-making and modular automation.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Health Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of service metrics (CPU, memory, latency, etc.)
- 🧠 **AI/ML Models:** Predict service failure probabilities and recommend optimal healing actions
- ⚡ **Failure Classification:** Differentiate between partial, cascading, and total service failures
- 🔁 **Automated Healing Engine:** Takes action to self-heal based on predictions and system rules
- 📊 **Prometheus Integration:** Collects and visualizes service metrics
- 🧩 **Kubernetes Orchestration:** Deploys and scales services with automated `kubectl` or API actions
